#Augmented assignment operators

friends = 100

# friends = friends + 1
# friends += 1
# friends = friends - 2
# friends -= 2
# friends = friends * 3
# friends *= 3
# friends = friends / 2
#friends /= 2
#friends = friends ** 2
#friends **= 2

#Once it divides it rounds down (towards negative infinity)(aka floor division) to the nearest whole number
#friends = friends // 2
#friends //= 2

# Once it divides, it returns the remainder of the division (after floor division)
# friends = friends % 2
# friends %= 2
#% is know as the modulus operator



print(friends)
